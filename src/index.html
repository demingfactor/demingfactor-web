        <h3>Graphic & Print</h3>
        <p>Every design sends a message. When you get the message right for your tribe, they can’t help but be drawn to it and your laser focussed signal separates from the noise.</p>

        <h3>User Interfaces & Experience</h3>
        <p>Most people don’t care about how awesome your product is, they care about how awesome they are when they use it.</p>

          I called on the them at DemingFactor to help us redevelop our app from something people used to a tool people raved about. We appreciated their amazing design work as well as their ability to convert their designs directly into code. Having a friendly design team that could produce production grade CSS and integrate with our git workflow was a godsend. <em>— Adam Davies, Head of Development</em>

        <h3>Branding & Strategy</h3>
        <p>There are no shortage of designers who like to make pretty things. We come from the school of design that design isn’t just about what it looks like, it’s how well it works.</p>

          “Over coffee the team helped me flesh out my ideas. The goal was to explore bringing an new premium italian food offering to Australia. The brand the team developed was sophisticated and considered, and despite none of them being Italian, felt authentically italian, Cantina Rotina reminded me of my youth.”
