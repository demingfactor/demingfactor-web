        <p>New site coming here.</p>
        <h2>Opinionated Sections</h2>
        <p>We use opinionated section tags that are great for containing text and copy.</p>
        <p>By default the section tag provides a nice measure (max-width) and left/right padding.</p>
        <p>If your not sure what we're talking about, just make sure all text is inside sections.</p>
        <p>Keep full screen images outside of section tags.</p>
        <p>Ok, go ahead, delete all these words, you don't need them now.</p>
