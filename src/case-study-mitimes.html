                        Ever had to keep timesheets; wished it could be automated? That’s the goal of mitimes, an ambitious new web application for lawyers. The existing application was being used in law firms but the issue was
                        getting new lawyers to stick with a new product that felt foreign and uninviting.

                    <p>
                        We were engaged to help the team draw insights from the previous versions of the app and create
                        a unified vision for a corporate application that lawyers would not only quickly grasp but would love to adopt to
                        assist in their daily duties.

                    <p>
                        As Media Designers we worked with the team to create a clear vision for the app. We undertook
                        user testing, rebranding,
                        created many interactive prototypes as well as coded the front end in collaboration with
                        software development team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than timesheets as a deadline necessity our strategy focussed around helping lawyers
                        stay in their flow.

                        The brand is about what we call ‘Positive Time’, when you have enough time and are in flow
                        rather than inside of rush
                        and deadlines.

                    <p>
                        A pendulum device informed the brand language and was deeply integrated as we undertook the
                        branding and the day-to-day
                        work of interface design and front end coding.

                        The new mitimes was well received by the industry. Leveraging the available prototypes and the
                        focus on solving a real
                        user need while creating a product that lawyers actually wanted to use day-in-day-out, mitimes
                        locked in a distribution
                        partnership with a major national legal software provider and at launch have attracted many new
                        firms to the product.
